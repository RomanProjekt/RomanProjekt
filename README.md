# About me:
Hello, I am Roman and software developer!

I am an intrinsically-motivated person who enjoys working in a team and developing new creative and improved solutions.

To be always up to date, I improve my current IT knowledge and teach myself new programming languages 
(e.g.: Typescript, C#), as well as modern frameworks (e.g.: Spring Boot, Angular + Restful) 
with books, tutorials and documentations.

I implement this learned IT knowledge in private practical examples, as well as in my own private projects. 
These practical projects are managed in my Github. 
Thereby I try to learn new skills and develop improved solutions in programming.
